The flu vaccine app uses a priority query system, assessing vaccination urgency based on age and health. This allows users to swiftly gauge their priority for the vaccine. Utilizing a PQ data structure optimizes storage and retrieval, ensuring efficient prioritization based on age and medical condition. For instance, an elderly patient with a medical condition receives a higher priority than a healthy younger patient.
